`bundle exec jekyll serve`

[Updating](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) the GitHub Pages gem
Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. If the github-pages gem on your computer is out of date with the github-pages gem on the GitHub Pages server, your site may look different when built locally than when published on GitHub. To avoid this, regularly update the github-pages gem on your computer.

Update the github-pages gem.
- Open Terminal.
- If you installed Bundler, run `bundle update github-pages`.
- If you don't have Bundler installed, run `gem update github-pages`.
